- All output files generated
- No errors or warnings remaining
- Performance optimizations implemented
- Original Stata/R functionality fully replicated

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è PDF Output Issues to Address
**Problem:** While the code runs through to completion without failure, there are issues with the PDF image output that need to be fixed:

1. **Figure 3 Implementation:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - **Issue:** First data point was always zero and not meaningful for the plot
   - **Fix:** Removed first data point from all arrays (years, gdp_cc_mean, gdp_nocc_mean, confidence intervals) before plotting
   - **Code:** Added explicit array slicing `[1:]` with clear comment explaining the removal
   - **Result:** Plot now starts with meaningful data points, eliminating the zero-value artifact

2. **Missing Country Logging:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - **Issue:** Countries missing from temperature changes dictionary were silently defaulting to zero/0.01
   - **Fix:** Added explicit logging in all four projection methods to track missing countries
   - **Implementation:** Enhanced `project_pooled_no_lag`, `project_rich_poor_no_lag`, `project_pooled_5_lag`, and `project_rich_poor_5_lag` methods
   - **Logging:** Now reports which countries are missing and defaulting to what values
   - **Benefit:** Improved debugging and data coverage transparency
   - **Issue:** Figure 3 was previously just a placeholder
   - **Solution:** Implemented proper GDP per capita projection plots
   - **Status:** Now shows time series for pooled/rich-poor models across base/SSP3/SSP5 scenarios

2. **Figure 4 Implementation:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - **Issue:** Figure 4 was previously just a placeholder
   - **Solution:** Implemented climate change impact analysis with percentage changes
   - **Status:** Now shows percentage changes in GDP per capita with confidence intervals

3. **PDF Generation Issues:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION
   - **Issue:** PDF files may not be generating properly or may have formatting issues
   - **Potential Causes:** 
     - Matplotlib backend issues
     - Font/encoding problems
     - File permission issues
     - Memory/resource constraints
   - **Next Steps:** 
     - Verify PDF files are actually created in `figures/` directory
     - Check PDF file sizes and content
     - Test with different matplotlib backends if needed
     - Ensure proper figure sizing and layout

4. **Figure Quality Issues:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION
   - **Issue:** Generated figures may not match original paper quality
   - **Potential Issues:**
     - Color schemes may differ from original
     - Font sizes and styles may need adjustment
     - Axis labels and titles may need refinement
     - Confidence interval visualization may need improvement
   - **Next Steps:**
     - Compare generated figures with original paper
     - Adjust styling to match original aesthetics
     - Verify all data is being plotted correctly

#### üéØ Ready for Production Use (After PDF Fixes)
**Next Steps:**

3. **Full Bootstrap:** Change `N_BOOTSTRAP = 1000` for production runs
4. **Documentation:** Create user guide and technical documentation
5. **Validation:** Cross-check key statistics and figures

### Key Issues Resolved Throughout Development

#### 1. ‚úÖ Interaction Term Issues (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Code was trying to access formula-style interaction terms like `'UDel_temp_popweight:UDel_temp_popweight_2'` that don't exist in Python/statsmodels.

**Solution:** Created explicit interaction columns and updated all references:
- `temp_poor = UDel_temp_popweight * poor`
- `temp2_poor = UDel_temp_popweight_2 * poor`
- `temp_early = UDel_temp_popweight * early`
- `temp2_early = UDel_temp_popweight_2 * early`

#### 2. ‚úÖ DataFrame Fragmentation (PERFORMANCE FIX)
**Problem:** `PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented` from inefficient time trend creation.

**Solution:** Refactored `create_time_trends()` to add all columns at once using `pd.concat()`.

#### 3. ‚úÖ Territory Filtering (DATA QUALITY FIX)
**Problem:** Duplicate ISO codes from territories (e.g., ISR/NOR having multiple entries).

**Solution:** Implemented territory filtering in Step 2 to exclude territories like "West Bank", "Gaza Strip", "Bouvet Island", etc.

#### 4. ‚úÖ Country Code Mappings (COMPATIBILITY FIX)
**Problem:** Mismatched country codes between datasets (COD/ZAR, ROU/ROM).

**Solution:** Implemented country code mapping system across all steps.

#### 5. ‚úÖ Temperature Constraint (MODEL FIX)
**Problem:** Out-of-sample temperature protection needed.

**Solution:** Implemented 30¬∞C temperature capping in Step 4.

#### 6. ‚úÖ 5-Lag Model Implementation (FEATURE COMPLETION)
**Problem:** Original implementation missing 5-lag models.

**Solution:** Implemented full 5-lag bootstrap and projection methods.

#### 7. ‚úÖ Figure 3 and 4 Implementation (VISUALIZATION FIX)
**Problem:** Figures 3 and 4 were just placeholders.

**Solution:** Implemented proper projection visualization:
- Figure 3: GDP per capita projections with confidence intervals
- Figure 4: Climate change impact analysis with percentage changes

### Working Style and Preferences

#### User Preferences (Important to Remember)
1. **Diagnostic-First Approach:** Always add diagnostic code to understand problems before implementing fixes
2. **Avoid Piecemeal Solutions:** Don't just add lines of code to get through immediate errors
3. **Comprehensive Understanding:** Analyze diagnostic output to identify root causes
4. **Systematic Fixes:** Propose and implement comprehensive solutions based on understanding
5. **Clean Code:** Prefer clean, maintainable solutions over quick workarounds
6. **Transparency:** Add original Stata/R code as comments for documentation and debugging
7. **Original Code Comments:** Since this is a replication project, include original Stata/R code comments before each code block that reproduces that functionality for transparency and debugging purposes

#### Development Philosophy
- **Understand before fixing:** Always diagnose the underlying cause
- **Fix systematically:** Apply solutions across all affected areas
- **Document thoroughly:** Keep clear records of what was done and why
- **Test incrementally:** Verify each fix before moving to the next issue
- **Maintain transparency:** Include original code references for replication verification

### Special Note: iso_id Usage and Best Practices

- **iso_id** is the country identifier (e.g., 'AFG', 'AGO') and should:
  - Be used for clustering/grouping in regressions (e.g., cluster(iso_id))
  - Be used for merging/joining, filtering, or grouping as a string/categorical
  - **Never** be included as a numeric variable or dummy in regression models

- **Country dummy variables** (e.g., iso_AFG, iso_AGO, ...) should:
  - Be created using pd.get_dummies(self.data['iso_id'], prefix='iso')
  - Always drop one dummy (reference category) to avoid multicollinearity (as in Stata's i.iso_id)
  - Always explicitly exclude 'iso_id' from any list of dummy variables used in regression

- **If you add new regression routines or scripts:**
  - Always check dummy creation logic to ensure iso_id is not included as a numeric variable
  - Use iso_id only for clustering/grouping, not as a regression variable

- **Summary Table:**

| Use Case                | Safe? | Notes                                      |
|-------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| Regression variables    | ‚úÖ    | Exclude iso_id, use only dummies            |
| Clustering/grouping     | ‚úÖ    | Use iso_id as string/categorical            |
| Data merges/joins       | ‚úÖ    | Fine as long as not used as numeric         |
| Feature engineering     | ‚úÖ    | Fine if not included as numeric in models   |
| Exporting data          | ‚úÖ    | Keep as string/categorical                  |
| New scripts/steps       | ‚ö†Ô∏è    | Always check dummy creation logic           |

**Key Principle:**
> Only use iso_id for clustering/grouping, never as a regression variable. Always drop one country dummy to avoid collinearity.

### Performance Improvements Made
1. **DataFrame Fragmentation:** Eliminated by creating all time trend columns at once
2. **Boolean Conversion:** Fixed warnings by using proper `.loc` access
3. **Bootstrap Speed:** Reduced from 1000 to 10 replications for testing
4. **Memory Efficiency:** Optimized column creation and concatenation
5. **Territory Filtering:** Improved data quality by removing duplicate ISO codes
6. **Country Code Mapping:** Enhanced compatibility across datasets

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 (win32 10.0.26100)
- **Shell:** PowerShell (C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe)

### Output Management (2025-01-27 Update)
- **Timestamped Output Directories:** Each run creates `./data/output_YYMMDD_HHMMSS/` directory
- **Timestamped Figures Directories:** Each run creates `./data/figures_YYMMDD_HHMMSS/` directory
- **Timestamped Log Files:** Log files named `burke_replication_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` in project root
- **Run Isolation:** Multiple runs can be executed without overwriting previous outputs
- **Output-Log Correlation:** Same timestamp used for output directory, figures directory, and log file
- **Centralized Logging:** All step files now use the centralized `setup_logging()` function from `config.py`
- **Individual Step Support:** Fixed timestamp consistency for running individual steps (e.g., just step1) - all steps now use the same timestamp for a given run

*Session Status: ‚úÖ FULL PIPELINE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY*
*Next: Fix PDF output issues, then results verification and production configuration* 

### PDF Output and Figure Quality Issues - Progress Update (2024-07-12)

- **Figure 3 Axis Label Issue:**
  - Diagnosed the problem as axis labels being cluttered with large numbers for SSP3 and SSP5 scenarios.
  - Implemented scientific notation for y-axis labels when values exceed 1e6, improving figure readability.
  - Diagnostic code confirmed that data shapes and types are correct; the issue was purely with axis formatting.

- **Next Challenge:**
  - The values for SSP3 and SSP5 in Figure 3 are extremely large ("blowing up").
  - **Next step:** Systematically diagnose why the GDP per capita projections for these scenarios are so high, focusing on the underlying data and projection logic.

### Step 1 Refactoring - Unified Regression Function (2025-07-30)

#### ‚úÖ Major Code Restructuring Completed
**Objective:** Refactor `step1_data_preparation.py` to replace seven separate OLS calls with a single unified `run_regression()` function while maintaining identical results.

#### ‚úÖ Key Accomplishments
