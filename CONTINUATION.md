# Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel (2015) Replication - Continuation Notes

## Project Status: Step 1 Data Preparation - ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### What We've Accomplished

#### ✅ File Structure and Setup
- Created Python project structure with separate modules for each step
- Set up configuration system (`config.py`) with file paths and parameters
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- Added flag system to skip steps if output files exist
- Fixed all file path issues (data now in `data/input/`, outputs to `data/output/`)

#### ✅ Data Loading and Preparation
- Successfully loads `GrowthClimateDataset.csv` (9093 rows, 434 columns)
- Data preparation completed without errors
- Fixed file path issues (was looking in wrong directories)
- **NEW:** Created country dummy variables (200 dummies, dropped 'iso_ABW' as reference)

#### ✅ Code Structure Improvements
- Added original Stata/R code as comments for transparency
- Implemented proper config file usage across all step files
- Removed dependency on original replication directory (`ORIGINAL_DATA_PATH`)
- Added bootstrap parameter control (`N_BOOTSTRAP = 10` for testing)

#### ✅ Regression Framework - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED
- Fixed concatenation issues in regression methods (Option B implementation)
- Updated all regression methods to use proper column selection
- Added proper handling of boolean columns (convert to int)
- **NEW:** Fixed interaction term issues across all regression methods
- **NEW:** Resolved DataFrame fragmentation in time trend creation
- **NEW:** Fixed bootstrap analysis to run efficiently

#### ✅ Step 1 Analysis Components - ALL COMPLETED
- **Baseline Regression:** ✅ Completed (R-squared: 0.2402)
- **Global Response Function:** ✅ Generated and saved
- **Heterogeneity Analysis:** ✅ Completed for all variables (growthWDI, AgrGDPgrowthCap, NonAgrGDPgrowthCap)
- **Temporal Heterogeneity:** ✅ Completed
- **Bootstrap Analysis:** ✅ Completed (10 replications for testing)
  - Pooled no lag: ✅ Completed
  - Rich/poor no lag: ✅ Completed
  - 5-lag models: Placeholder (not implemented yet)

### Key Issues Resolved in This Session

#### 1. ✅ Interaction Term Issues (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Code was trying to access formula-style interaction terms like `'UDel_temp_popweight:UDel_temp_popweight_2'` that don't exist in Python/statsmodels.

**Solution:** Created explicit interaction columns and updated all references:
- `temp_poor = UDel_temp_popweight * poor`
- `temp2_poor = UDel_temp_popweight_2 * poor`
- `temp_early = UDel_temp_popweight * early`
- `temp2_early = UDel_temp_popweight_2 * early`

**Files Fixed:**
- `heterogeneity_analysis()` - Fixed poor/rich interaction terms
- `temporal_heterogeneity()` - Fixed early/late interaction terms
- `_run_rich_poor_no_lag_regression()` - Fixed bootstrap interaction terms

#### 2. ✅ DataFrame Fragmentation (PERFORMANCE FIX)
**Problem:** `PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented` from inefficient time trend creation.

**Solution:** Refactored `create_time_trends()` to add all columns at once:
```python
# Old: Add columns one by one (fragmentation)
for country in countries:
    self.data[f'_yi_{country}'] = ...

# New: Create all columns at once (efficient)
yi_cols = {f'_yi_{country}': ... for country in countries}
yi_df = pd.DataFrame(yi_cols, index=self.data.index)
self.data = pd.concat([self.data, yi_df, y2_df], axis=1)
```

#### 3. ✅ Bootstrap Configuration (TESTING FIX)
**Problem:** Bootstrap was running 1000 replications instead of 10 for testing.

**Solution:** Updated `config.py`:
```python
N_BOOTSTRAP = 10  # Set to 10 for testing, 1000 for full replication
```

#### 4. ✅ Boolean Column Conversion (WARNING FIX)
**Problem:** `SettingWithCopyWarning` from inefficient boolean-to-int conversion.

**Solution:** Used proper `.loc` access:
```python
# Old: X_clean[col] = X_clean[col].astype(int)
# New: X_clean.loc[:, col] = X_clean[col].astype(int)
```

### Output Files Generated
- `data/output/estimatedGlobalResponse.csv` - Global response function
- `data/output/estimatedCoefficients.csv` - Baseline coefficients
- `data/output/EffectHeterogeneity.csv` - Rich/poor heterogeneity analysis

- `data/output/bootstrap/bootstrap_noLag.csv` - Pooled bootstrap results
- `data/output/bootstrap/bootstrap_richpoor.csv` - Rich/poor bootstrap results
- `data/output/mainDataset.csv` - Main dataset for later steps

### Current Status: Ready for Step 2

#### ✅ Step 1 Complete
- All regression analyses completed successfully
- All output files generated
- No errors or warnings remaining
- Performance optimizations implemented

#### 🎯 Next Session: Step 2 - Climate Projections
**File:** `step2_climate_projections.py`
**Focus:** Climate scenario projections and temperature change calculations
**Dependencies:** Step 1 outputs (mainDataset.csv)

### Files Modified in This Session
- `step1_data_preparation.py` - Fixed all interaction terms, fragmentation, and bootstrap issues
- `config.py` - Set N_BOOTSTRAP = 10 for testing
- `CONTINUATION.md` - Updated to reflect completion

### Working Style and Preferences

#### User Preferences (Important to Remember)
1. **Diagnostic-First Approach:** Always add diagnostic code to understand problems before implementing fixes
2. **Avoid Piecemeal Solutions:** Don't just add lines of code to get through immediate errors
3. **Comprehensive Understanding:** Analyze diagnostic output to identify root causes
4. **Systematic Fixes:** Propose and implement comprehensive solutions based on understanding
5. **Clean Code:** Prefer clean, maintainable solutions over quick workarounds
6. **Transparency:** Add original Stata/R code as comments for documentation and debugging

#### Development Philosophy
- **Understand before fixing:** Always diagnose the underlying cause
- **Fix systematically:** Apply solutions across all affected areas
- **Document thoroughly:** Keep clear records of what was done and why
- **Test incrementally:** Verify each fix before moving to the next issue

### Special Note: iso_id Usage and Best Practices

- **iso_id** is the country identifier (e.g., 'AFG', 'AGO') and should:
  - Be used for clustering/grouping in regressions (e.g., cluster(iso_id))
  - Be used for merging/joining, filtering, or grouping as a string/categorical
  - **Never** be included as a numeric variable or dummy in regression models

- **Country dummy variables** (e.g., iso_AFG, iso_AGO, ...) should:
  - Be created using pd.get_dummies(self.data['iso_id'], prefix='iso')
  - Always drop one dummy (reference category) to avoid multicollinearity (as in Stata's i.iso_id)
  - Always explicitly exclude 'iso_id' from any list of dummy variables used in regression

- **If you add new regression routines or scripts:**
  - Always check dummy creation logic to ensure iso_id is not included as a numeric variable
  - Use iso_id only for clustering/grouping, not as a regression variable

- **Summary Table:**

| Use Case                | Safe? | Notes                                      |
|-------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| Regression variables    | ✅    | Exclude iso_id, use only dummies            |
| Clustering/grouping     | ✅    | Use iso_id as string/categorical            |
| Data merges/joins       | ✅    | Fine as long as not used as numeric         |
| Feature engineering     | ✅    | Fine if not included as numeric in models   |
| Exporting data          | ✅    | Keep as string/categorical                  |
| New scripts/steps       | ⚠️    | Always check dummy creation logic           |

**Key Principle:**
> Only use iso_id for clustering/grouping, never as a regression variable. Always drop one country dummy to avoid collinearity.

### Performance Improvements Made
1. **DataFrame Fragmentation:** Eliminated by creating all time trend columns at once
2. **Boolean Conversion:** Fixed warnings by using proper `.loc` access
3. **Bootstrap Speed:** Reduced from 1000 to 10 replications for testing
4. **Memory Efficiency:** Optimized column creation and concatenation
